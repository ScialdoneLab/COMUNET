## clustering_patternSearch tutorial
These tutorials handle embryo data
### 1_PrepareData.ipynb notebook
This notebook uses R code, please make sure an R kernel is installed for your jupiter notebook or copy the code and run it in an R environment.

This notebook describes the steps for:
* downloading the data
* cleaning the data (substet for E6.5 stage)
* filtering of cells (cell types that are represented by less than 5 cells are filtered out)
* subsetting the dataset randomly for 1500 cells
* normalising data with scran
* filtering genes (genes with mean expression less than 1 in all expressing cells are filtered out)

The **output** of this notebook is:
* counts_filtered_norm.txt a normalised (NOT log2 transformed) filtered count matrix (gene names in rows, cell IDs in columns)
* anno_filtered.txt an annotation matrix (containing columns "Cell" and "cell_type").

### 2_CellPhoneDBanalysis.ipynb notebook
This notebook uses CellPhoneDB venv, please make sure the venv kernel is installed for you jupiter notebook or run CellPhoneDB from the command line as described in the CellPhoneDB tutorial.

This notebook describes the steps for:
* installation of CellPhoneDB
* setting parameters for CellPhoneDB (gene_input_type = "gene_name", subsample = False) 
* running CellPhoneDB

The **input** of this notebook is:
* counts_filtered_norm.txt a normalised (NOT log2 transformed) filtered count matrix (gene names in rows, cell IDs in columns)

The **output** of this notebook is a "cpdb_output" folder that contains following files:
* deconvoluted.txt

**PLEASE NOTE** that CellPhoneDB analysis might give slightly different results when rerun on the same data, which might affect the downstream analysis. If you wish to reproduce the exact figures from the manuscript, please run the downstream analysis on cpdb_output_embryo output (please make sure to adjust the path name!).
