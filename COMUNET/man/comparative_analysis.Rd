\arguments{
\item{cond1_weight_array}{Numeric array: array of weighted adjacency matrices for condition 1.
Note that the function filters out empty weight arrays and the corresponding ligand-receptor pairs.}

\item{cond2_weight_array}{Numeric array: array of weighted adjacency matrices for condition 2.
Note that the function filters out empty weight arrays and the corresponding ligand-receptor pairs.}

\item{cond1_ligand_receptor_pair_df}{Character dataframe: data frame with columns "pair", "ligand", "ligand_complex_composition", "receptor", "receptor_complex_composition" for condition 1.}

\item{cond2_ligand_receptor_pair_df}{Character dataframe: data frame with columns "pair", "ligand", "ligand_complex_composition", "receptor", "receptor_complex_composition" for condition 2.}

\item{cond1_nodes}{Character string vector: a vector with all cell types in the data.
Please note that comparative_analysis expects nodes (i.e. cell types) to be the same in both conditions.}

\item{cond2_nodes}{Character string vector: a vector with all cell types in the data. Default value: cond1_nodes.

Please note that comparative_analysis expects nodes (i.e. cell types) to be the same in both conditions.}

\item{cond1_name}{Character string: sample name for condition 1.}

\item{cond2_name}{Character string: sample name for condition 2.}

\item{dissimilarity}{Function: dissimilarity function. Default value is d_normWeightDiff.}
}
\value{
a list of:

sorted_LRP_df: data.frame with columns:
	"pair" (character string): names of ligand-receptor pairs in the same form as they are in ligand_receptor_pair_df$pair
	"presence" (character string): whether the ligand-receptor pair is present in both conditions ("shared") or only in one of them.
	"dissimilarity" (numeric): dissimilarity value between the topology of ligand-receptor pair graph in two conditions. The smaller the dissimilarity value, the more similar is the graph topology between the two conditions.
	If a ligand-receptor pair is present only in one of the conditions, the dissimilarity is equal to 1.

dissim_cond1_cond2: numeric matrix            pairwise dissimilarity between all ligand-receptor pairs in the two conditions (condition 1 in rows, condition 2 in columns)
}
\description{
\code{comparative_analysis} performs comparative analysis between two conditions (e.g. two samples).
Given the results of a cell-cell communication analysis of two datasets including the same cell types,
COMUNET estimates the differences in the cell-cell communication patterns between corresponding interacting partners in the two datasets.
