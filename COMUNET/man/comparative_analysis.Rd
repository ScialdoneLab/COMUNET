\title{
Function to perform comparative analysis
}
\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
comparative_analysis(cond1_weight_array, cond2_weight_array, cond1_ligand_receptor_pair_df, cond2_ligand_receptor_pair_df, cond1_nodes, cond2_nodes = cond1_nodes, cond1_name, cond2_name, dissimilarity = d_normWeightDiff)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{cond1_weight_array}{
numeric array: array of weighted adjacency matrices for condition 1. Note that the function filters out empty weight arrays and the corresponding ligand-receptor pairs.
}
  \item{cond2_weight_array}{
numeric array: array of weighted adjacency matrices for condition 2. Note that the function filters out empty weight arrays and the corresponding ligand-receptor pairs
}
  \item{cond1_ligand_receptor_pair_df}{
character dataframe          data frame with columns "pair", "ligand", "ligand_complex_composition", "receptor", "receptor_complex_composition" for condition 1.
}
  \item{cond2_ligand_receptor_pair_df}{
character dataframe: data frame with columns "pair", "ligand", "ligand_complex_composition", "receptor", "receptor_complex_composition" for condition 2
}
  \item{cond1_nodes}{
character string vector: a vector with all cell types in the data. Please note that comparative_analysis expects nodes (i.e. cell types) to be the same in both conditions.
}
  \item{cond2_nodes}{
character string vector: a vector with all cell types in the data. Default value: cond1_nodes. Please note that comparative_analysis expects nodes (i.e. cell types) to be the same in both conditions.
}
  \item{cond1_name}{
character string: sample name for condition 1
}
  \item{cond2_name}{
character string: sample name for condition 2
}
  \item{dissimilarity}{
function: dissimilarity function. Default value is d_normWeightDiff
}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
a list of:

\item{sortedLRP_DF}{
dataframe with columns: "pair" (character string): names of ligand-receptor pairs in the same form as they are in ligand_receptor_pair_df$pair; "presence" (character string): name of the condition in which the ligand-receptor pair is present or "shared" if present in both conditions; dissimilarity (numeric): dissimilarity value between the topology of ligand-receptor pair graph in two conditions. The smaller the dissimilarity value, the more similar is the graph topology between the two conditions. If a ligand-receptor pair is present only in one of the conditions, the dissimilarity is equal to 1.
}
\item{dissim_cond1_cond2}{
numeric matrix: pairwise dissimilarity between all ligand-receptor pairs in the two conditions (condition 1 in rows, condition 2 in columns).
}
