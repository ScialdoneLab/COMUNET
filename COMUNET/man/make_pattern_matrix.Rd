\title{Makes a weight matrix for pattern of interest}
\usage{
make_pattern_matrix(communicating_nodes, nodes)
}
\arguments{
\item{communicating_nodes}{Character string vector: in form of c("cellType1_to_celltype2", "cell_type1_to_celltype3", ...), e.g. c("HSC_to_Tcells", "HSC_to_bcells", ...).}

\item{nodes}{Character string vector: of length n with all cell types in the data.}
}
\value{
weight matrix: numeric n x n matrix with values 0 or 1. Rows are nodes, columns are nodes.
Rows are regarded as sending cell type, columns are regarded as receiving cell types. 1 defines communication, 0 defines no communication
}
\description{
\code{make_pattern_matrix} makes a weight matrix for pattern of interest.
The rows and columns of the matrix contain all nodes.
The rows are considered as sending nodes and the columns are considered as receiving nodes.
The value of 1 represents an edge (i.e. cell types are communicating) and 0 represents no edge (i.e. cell types are not communicating).
