Description: COMUNET is a visualisation and analysis tool for 
	cell-cell communication. COMUNET uses multiplex networks to 
	represent and cluster all potential communication pathways 
	between cell types. It also enables the search for specific 
	patterns of communication and can perform comparative analysis 
	between two biological conditions.
